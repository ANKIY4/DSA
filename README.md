<h1>DSA in JAVA</h1>     

 About This Repo    
Welcome to my DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) repository! This is where I keep all the Java codes I write while learning DSA. It's my way of tracking progress and having a handy reference for future practice.    
    
 What You'll Find Here    
- Java implementations of different data structures and algorithms.    
- Well-structured and easy-to-follow code.    
- A collection of problems Iâ€™ve worked on while learning.    

 Why This Repo?    
- To document my DSA learning journey.    
- To have a personal library of solved problems.    
- To revisit concepts whenever needed.    
    
 How to Use    
- Clone the repo using:    
     
  git clone https://github.com/amankrm-dev/DSA.git
      
- Browse through different files and folders to explore various implementations.    
- Feel free to use the codes for learning purposes.
